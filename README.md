# Julia-qFenwick

Quantum simulation of fermionic systems using qubits will play an important role in current and
emerging quantum computing architectures. Limitations of small scale quantum computers will
help inform the roadmap to the future and here we present new tools for creating qubit operators
for fermionic systems. In this technical note, we give an introduction and a summary of our generalized
approach to Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transforms and beyond. In particular, the
parity tree forms the crux of our general approach. The most important parity tree is the Fenwick
Tree as detailed in our last publication. The corresponding code is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/jdwhitfield/Julia-qFenwick.
